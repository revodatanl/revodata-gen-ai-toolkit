    "tion, which can dominate application execution times.\n",
    "Recognizing this problem, researchers have developed\n",
    "specialized frameworks for some applications that re-\n",
    "quire data reuse. For example, Pregel [22] is a system for\n",
    "iterative graph computations that keeps intermediate data\n",
    "in memory, while HaLoop [7] offers an iterative MapRe-\n",
    "duce interface. However, these frameworks only support\n",
    "specific computation patterns (e.g., looping a series of\n",
    "MapReduce steps), and perform data sharing implicitly\n",
    "for these patterns. They do not provide abstractions for\n",
    "more general reuse, e.g., to let a user load several datasets\n",

    "fine RDDs (§2.1) and introduce their programming inter-\n",
    "face in Spark (§2.2). We then compare RDDs with finer-\n",
    "grained shared memory abstractions (§2.3). Finally, we\n",
    "discuss limitations of the RDD model (§2.4).\n",
    "2.1 RDD Abstraction\n",
    "Formally, an RDD is a read-only, partitioned collection\n",
    "of records. RDDs can only be created through determin-\n",
    "istic operations on either (1) data in stable storage or (2)\n",
    "other RDDs. We call these operations transformations to\n",
    "differentiate them from other operations on RDDs. Ex-\n",
    "amples of transformations include map, filter, and join.\n",
    "2\n",
    "RDDs do not need to be materialized at all times. In-\n",
    "stead, an RDD has enough information about how it was\n",
    "derived from other datasets (its lineage) to compute its\n",
    "partitions from data in stable storage. This is a power-\n",
    "ful property: in essence, a program cannot reference an\n",
    "RDD that it cannot reconstruct after a failure.\n",
    "Finally, users can control two other aspects of RDDs:\n",
    "persistence and partitioning. Users can indicate which\n",
    "RDDs they will reuse and choose a storage strategy for\n",
    "them (e.g., in-memory storage). They can also ask that\n",
    "an RDD’s elements be partitioned across machines based\n",
    "on a key in each record. This is useful for placement op-\n",
    "timizations, such as ensuring that two datasets that will\n",
    "be joined together are hash-partitioned in the same way.\n",
    "2.2 Spark Programming Interface\n",
    "Spark exposes RDDs through a language-integrated API\n",
    "similar to DryadLINQ [31] and FlumeJava [8], where\n",
    "each dataset is represented as an object and transforma-\n",
    "tions are invoked using methods on these objects.\n",
    "Programmers start by defining one or more RDDs\n",
    "through transformations on data in stable storage\n",
    "(e.g., map and filter). They can then use these RDDs in\n",
    "actions, which are operations that return a value to the\n",
    "application or export data to a storage system. Examples\n",
    "of actions include count (which returns the number of\n",
    "elements in the dataset), collect (which returns the ele-\n",
    "ments themselves), and save (which outputs the dataset\n",
    "to a storage system). Like DryadLINQ, Spark computes\n",
    "RDDs lazily the first time they are used in an action, so\n",
    "that it can pipeline transformations.\n",
    "In addition, programmers can call a persist method to\n",
    "indicate which RDDs they want to reuse in future oper-\n",
    "ations. Spark keeps persistent RDDs in memory by de-\n",
    "fault, but it can spill them to disk if there is not enough\n",
    "RAM. Users can also request other persistence strategies,\n",
    "such as storing the RDD only on disk or replicating it\n",
    "across machines, through flags to persist. Finally, users\n",
    "can set a persistence priority on each RDD to specify\n",
    "which in-memory data should spill to disk first.\n",
    "2.2.1 Example: Console Log Mining\n",
    "Suppose that a web service is experiencing errors and an\n",
    "operator wants to search terabytes of logs in the Hadoop\n",
    "filesystem (HDFS) to find the cause. Using Spark, the op-\n",

    "RAM across a set of nodes and query them interactively.\n",
    "She would first type the following Scala code:\n",

    "ment mutable state by having multiple RDDs to represent multiple ver-\n",
    "sions of a dataset. We made RDDs immutable to make it easier to de-\n",

    "errors = lines.filter(_.startsWith(\"ERROR\"))\n",
    "errors.persist()\n",
    "Line 1 defines an RDD backed by an HDFS file (as a\n",
    "collection of lines of text), while line 2 derives a filtered\n",
    "RDD from it. Line 3 then asks for errors to persist in\n",
    "memory so that it can be shared across queries. Note that\n",
    "the argument to filter is Scala syntax for a closure.\n",
    "At this point, no work has been performed on the clus-\n",
    "ter. However, the user can now use the RDD in actions,\n",
    "e.g., to count the number of messages:\n",
    "errors.count()\n",
    "The user can also perform further transformations on\n",
    "the RDD and use their results, as in the following lines:\n",
    "// Count errors mentioning MySQL:\n",
    "errors.filter(_.contains(\"MySQL\")).count()\n",
    "// Return the time fields of errors mentioning\n",
    "// HDFS as an array (assuming time is field\n",
    "// number 3 in a tab-separated format):\n",
    "errors.filter(_.contains(\"HDFS\"))\n",
    ".map(_.split(’\\t’)(3))\n",
    ".collect()\n",
    "After the first action involving errors runs, Spark will\n",
    "store the partitions of errors in memory, greatly speed-\n",
    "ing up subsequent computations on it. Note that the base\n",
    "RDD, lines, is not loaded into RAM. This is desirable\n",

    "2.3 Advantages of the RDD Model\n",
    "To understand the benefits of RDDs as a distributed\n",
    "memory abstraction, we compare them against dis-\n",
    "tributed shared memory (DSM) in Table 1. In DSM sys-\n",
    "tems, applications read and write to arbitrary locations in\n",
    "a global address space. Note that under this definition, we\n",
    "include not only traditional shared memory systems [24],\n",
    "but also other systems where applications make fine-\n",
    "grained writes to shared state, including Piccolo [27],\n",
    "which provides a shared DHT, and distributed databases.\n",
    "DSM is a very general abstraction, but this generality\n",
    "makes it harder to implement in an efficient and fault-\n",
    "tolerant manner on commodity clusters.\n",
    "The main difference between RDDs and DSM is that\n",
    "RDDs can only be created (“written”) through coarse-\n",
    "grained transformations, while DSM allows reads and\n",
    "writes to each memory location.3 This restricts RDDs\n",
    "to applications that perform bulk writes, but allows for\n",
    "more efficient fault tolerance. In particular, RDDs do not\n",
    "need to incur the overhead of checkpointing, as they can\n",
    "be recovered using lineage.4 Furthermore, only the lost\n",
    "partitions of an RDD need to be recomputed upon fail-\n",
    "ure, and they can be recomputed in parallel on different\n",
    "nodes, without having to roll back the whole program.\n",
    "A second benefit of RDDs is that their immutable na-\n",
    "ture lets a system mitigate slow nodes (stragglers) by run-\n",
    "ning backup copies of slow tasks as in MapReduce [10].\n",
    "Backup tasks would be hard to implement with DSM, as\n",
    "the two copies of a task would access the same memory\n",
    "locations and interfere with each other’s updates.\n",
    "Finally, RDDs provide two other benefits over DSM.\n",
    "First, in bulk operations on RDDs, a runtime can sched-\n",
    "3Note that reads on RDDs can still be fine-grained. For example, an\n",
    "application can treat an RDD as a large read-only lookup table.\n",
    "4In some applications, it can still help to checkpoint RDDs with\n",
    "long lineage chains, as we discuss in Section 5.4. However, this can be\n",

    "2.4 Applications Not Suitable for RDDs\n",
    "As discussed in the Introduction, RDDs are best suited\n",

    "ficiently remember each transformation as one step in a\n",

    "suitable for applications that make asynchronous fine-\n",
    "grained updates to shared state, such as a storage sys-\n",
    "tem for a web application or an incremental web crawler.\n",
    "For these applications, it is more efficient to use systems\n",
    "that perform traditional update logging and data check-\n",
    "pointing, such as databases, RAMCloud [25], Percolator\n",
    "[26] and Piccolo [27]. Our goal is to provide an efficient\n",
    "programming model for batch analytics and leave these\n",
    "asynchronous applications to specialized systems.\n",
    "3 Spark Programming Interface\n",
    "Spark provides the RDD abstraction through a language-\n",
    "integrated API similar to DryadLINQ [31] in Scala [2],\n",
    "a statically typed functional programming language for\n",
    "the Java VM. We chose Scala due to its combination of\n",
    "conciseness (which is convenient for interactive use) and\n",
    "efficiency (due to static typing). However, nothing about\n",
    "the RDD abstraction requires a functional language.\n",
    "To use Spark, developers write a driver program that\n",
    "connects to a cluster of workers, as shown in Figure 2.\n",
    "The driver defines one or more RDDs and invokes ac-\n",
    "tions on them. Spark code on the driver also tracks the\n",
    "RDDs’ lineage. The workers are long-lived processes\n",
    "that can store RDD partitions in RAM across operations.\n",
    "As we showed in the log mining example in Sec-\n",
    "tion 2.2.1, users provide arguments to RDD opera-\n",
    "tions like map by passing closures (function literals).\n",
    "Scala represents each closure as a Java object, and\n",
    "these objects can be serialized and loaded on another\n",
    "node to pass the closure across the network. Scala also\n",
    "saves any variables bound in the closure as fields in\n",
    "the Java object. For example, one can write code like\n",
    "var x = 5; rdd.map(_ + x) to add 5 to each element\n",
    "of an RDD.5\n",
    "RDDs themselves are statically typed objects\n",
    "parametrized by an element type. For example,\n",
    "RDD[Int] is an RDD of integers. However, most of our\n",
    "examples omit types since Scala supports type inference.\n",
    "Although our method of exposing RDDs in Scala is\n",
    "conceptually simple, we had to work around issues with\n",
    "Scala’s closure objects using reflection [33]. We also\n",
    "needed more work to make Spark usable from the Scala\n",
    "interpreter, as we shall discuss in Section 5.2. Nonethe-\n",
    "less, we did not have to modify the Scala compiler.\n",
    "3.1 RDD Operations in Spark\n",
    "Table 2 lists the main RDD transformations and actions\n",
    "available in Spark. We give the signature of each oper-\n",
    "ation, showing type parameters in square brackets. Re-\n",
    "call that transformations are lazy operations that define a\n",
    "new RDD, while actions launch a computation to return\n",
    "a value to the program or write data to external storage.\n",
    "Note that some operations, such as join, are only avail-\n",
    "able on RDDs of key-value pairs. Also, our function\n",
    "names are chosen to match other APIs in Scala and other\n",
    "functional languages; for example, map is a one-to-one\n",
    "mapping, while flatMap maps each input value to one or\n",
    "more outputs (similar to the map in MapReduce).\n",
    "In addition to these operators, users can ask for an\n",
    "RDD to persist. Furthermore, users can get an RDD’s\n",
    "partition order, which is represented by a Partitioner\n",
    "class, and partition another dataset according to it. Op-\n",
    "erations such as groupByKey, reduceByKey and sort au-\n",

    "3.2 Example Applications\n",

    "tion is choosing a representation for them that can track\n",
    "lineage across a wide range of transformations. Ideally,\n",
    "a system implementing RDDs should provide as rich\n",
    "a set of transformation operators as possible (e.g., the\n",
    "ones in Table 2), and let users compose them in arbitrary\n",
    "ways. We propose a simple graph-based representation\n",
    "for RDDs that facilitates these goals. We have used this\n",
    "representation in Spark to support a wide range of trans-\n",
    "formations without adding special logic to the scheduler\n",
    "for each one, which greatly simplified the system design.\n",
    "In a nutshell, we propose representing each RDD\n",
    "through a common interface that exposes five pieces of\n",
    "information: a set of partitions, which are atomic pieces\n",
    "of the dataset; a set of dependencies on parent RDDs;\n",
    "a function for computing the dataset based on its par-\n",
    "ents; and metadata about its partitioning scheme and data\n",
    "placement. For example, an RDD representing an HDFS\n",
    "file has a partition for each block of the file and knows\n",
    "which machines each block is on. Meanwhile, the result\n",

    "Table 3: Interface used to represent RDDs in Spark.\n",
    "of a map on this RDD has the same partitions, but applies\n",
    "the map function to the parent’s data when computing its\n",
    "elements. We summarize this interface in Table 3.\n",
    "The most interesting question in designing this inter-\n",
    "face is how to represent dependencies between RDDs.\n",
    "We found it both sufficient and useful to classify depen-\n",
    "dencies into two types: narrow dependencies, where each\n",
    "partition of the parent RDD is used by at most one parti-\n",
    "tion of the child RDD, wide dependencies, where multi-\n",
    "ple child partitions may depend on it. For example, map\n",
    "leads to a narrow dependency, while join leads to to wide\n",
    "dependencies (unless the parents are hash-partitioned).\n",
    "Figure 4 shows other examples.\n",
    "This distinction is useful for two reasons. First, narrow\n",
    "dependencies allow for pipelined execution on one clus-\n",
    "ter node, which can compute all the parent partitions. For\n",
    "example, one can apply a map followed by a filter on an\n",
    "element-by-element basis. In contrast, wide dependen-\n",
    "cies require data from all parent partitions to be available\n",
    "and to be shuffled across the nodes using a MapReduce-\n",
    "like operation. Second, recovery after a node failure is\n",
    "more efficient with a narrow dependency, as only the lost\n",
    "parent partitions need to be recomputed, and they can be\n",
    "recomputed in parallel on different nodes. In contrast, in\n",
    "a lineage graph with wide dependencies, a single failed\n",
    "node might cause the loss of some partition from all the\n",

    "cludes a singleton object that contains the variables or\n",
    "functions on that line and runs the line’s code in an ini-\n",
    "tialize method. For example, if the user types var x = 5\n",
    "followed by println(x), the interpreter defines a class\n",
    "called Line1 containing x and causes the second line to\n",
    "compile to println(Line1.getInstance().x).\n",
    "We made two changes to the interpreter in Spark:\n",
    "1. Class shipping: To let the worker nodes fetch the\n",
    "bytecode for the classes created on each line, we\n",
    "made the interpreter serve these classes over HTTP.\n",
    "2. Modified code generation: Normally, the singleton\n",
    "object created for each line of code is accessed\n",
    "through a static method on its corresponding class.\n",
    "This means that when we serialize a closure refer-\n",
    "encing a variable defined on a previous line, such as\n",
    "Line1.x in the example above, Java will not trace\n",
    "through the object graph to ship the Line1 instance\n",
    "wrapping around x. Therefore, the worker nodes will\n",
    "not receive x. We modified the code generation logic\n",
    "to reference the instance of each line object directly.\n",
    "Figure 6 shows how the interpreter translates a set of\n",

    "To manage the limited memory available, we use an\n",
    "LRU eviction policy at the level of RDDs. When a new\n",
    "RDD partition is computed but there is not enough space\n",
    "to store it, we evict a partition from the least recently ac-\n",

    "the new partition. In that case, we keep the old partition\n",

    "likely that the partition already in memory will be needed\n",
    "in the future. We found this default policy to work well in\n",
    "all our applications so far, but we also give users further\n",
    "control via a “persistence priority” for each RDD.\n",
    "Finally, each instance of Spark on a cluster currently\n",
    "has its own separate memory space. In future work, we\n",
    "plan to investigate sharing RDDs across instances of\n",
    "Spark through a unified memory manager.\n",
    "5.4 Support for Checkpointing\n",
    "Although lineage can always be used to recover RDDs\n",
    "after a failure, such recovery may be time-consuming for\n",

    "to checkpoint some RDDs to stable storage.\n",
    "In general, checkpointing is useful for RDDs with long\n",

    "fraction of the cost of replicating the whole RDD.\n",
    "Spark currently provides an API for checkpointing (a\n",

    "the storage abstraction behind this interface, we allow it\n",
    "to support a far broader class of applications.\n",
    "A third class of systems provide high-level interfaces\n",
    "for specific classes of applications requiring data sharing.\n",
    "For example, Pregel [22] supports iterative graph appli-\n",

    "a distributed storage abstraction explicitly and can thus\n",
    "support applications that these specialized systems do\n",
    "not capture, such as interactive data mining.\n",
    "Finally, some systems expose shared mutable state\n",
